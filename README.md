**GRAF:** Great Rad-Ass Framework

This is a framework for Discord bots to use that makes it stupidly easy to build a bot with Node.js.
It is written in ES2017 using Babel, and is built with [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) and Node.js.

## Features
GRAF contains loads of functionality that any bots built on it can use.
Here's a quick list:
- Command framework (with plain names, argument parsing, and optional regex patterns - probably the most robust command system of any bot)
- Module system (allows you to disable modules and individual commands per server)
- Admin/moderator permissions (moderators are configurable)
- Channel restrictions (allow the bot to operate only in specific channels in a server)
- Configurable command prefix (change the trigger for commands)
- Help system and detailed about command
- Update checking for your bot

## Installation
**Requires Node.js 6.0.0 or newer.**  
Add discord-graf as a dependency: `npm install --save discord-graf`

## Documentation
Coming soon&trade;.  
Until documentation is available, take a look at [RPBot](https://github.com/Gawdl3y/discord-rpbot) to see how the framework is used.
