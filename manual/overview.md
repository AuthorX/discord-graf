## Information
**GRAF:** Great Rad-Ass Framework

This is a framework for Discord bots to use that makes it stupidly easy to build a bot with Node.js.  
It is written in ES2017 using Babel, and is built on top of [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js).

## Features
GRAF contains loads of functionality that any bots built on it can use.
Here's a quick list:
- Command framework (with plain names, aliases, argument parsing, and optional regex patterns - probably the most robust command system of any bot)
- Module system (allows you to disable modules and individual commands per server)
- Admin/moderator permissions (moderators are configurable)
- Channel restrictions (allow the bot to operate only in specific channels in a server)
- Configurable command prefix (change the trigger for commands)
- Help system and detailed about command
- Eval command with a system for registering your own objects to make available in its scope, and some utilities
- Lots of utility methods to simplify your logic
- Update checking for your bot
